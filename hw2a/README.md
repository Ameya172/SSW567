# Triangle567
The code in this repository contains two files:

Triangle.py - This file contains a function called classifyTriangle that takes three integer values corresponding to the lengths of the three sides of a triangle and returns a string with the type of triangle. The possible return values are:
'Equilateral' - if all three sides are equal
'Isosceles' - if exactly one pair of sides are equal
'Scalene' - if no pair of sides are equal
'NotATriangle' - if the input values do not form a valid triangle
'Right' - if the triangle is a right triangle
TestTriangle.py - This file contains unit tests for the classifyTriangle function. It includes test cases for all possible return values of the function, as well as some invalid input cases.
How to run the tests
To run the tests, make sure you have Python installed on your machine, then navigate to the directory containing the TestTriangle.py file and run the following command:
	python3 -m unittest TestTriangle -v
This will run all of the tests and output the results to the console.

Notes on the classifyTriangle function
The classifyTriangle function includes input validation to ensure that all input values are integers between 1 and 200, inclusive. If any of the input values are invalid, the function returns 'InvalidInput'.

The function also includes logic to determine whether the input values form a valid triangle.
